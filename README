This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1179

The focus of this script is to provide context-sensitive word completion - taking advantage of the popular ctags utility and Vim's built-in perl features. 

Suppose you have an instance of an object (o), and you've typed:

o.set_

While you are still in insert mode, press CTRL-J, and this script will then look up the first member of that object that starts with "set_" and complete it for you, like this:

o.set_range(integer max, integer min)

If this isn't the completion that you want, then press CTRL-J again for the next member that starts with "set_":

o.set_name(string name)

and again for the next one:

o.set_value

If you've gone too far then you can go back with CTRL-K. After each completion you are left in insert mode - so you can just continue typing when you've found the one you want.

The object can also be replaced with a struct, class, 'this', or 'super'.

Completions can also be made after the open parentheses to complete the list of parameters:

o.set_range(<c-j>

Or after the function:

o.get_name().compar<c-j>

Pressing CTRL-S will skip through the function parameters, visually selecting each in turn - useful for filling in the parameters after completing a function.
